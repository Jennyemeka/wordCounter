# Word Counter

## Overview

The Word Counter is a simple Java program that counts the number of words in a given sentence. It utilizes the JOptionPane class for user input and graphical display.

## WHY THIS PROJECT
1. Conceptual Simplicity:

The project involves fundamental programming concepts such as input/output, string manipulation, and basic logic, making it accessible for beginners.

2. Real-World Applicability:

Word counting is a common and practical task, and by building a Word Counter, beginners can see the immediate real-world applicability of their coding skills.

3. I learnt how to use the split method to make sure it counts the words not character.
